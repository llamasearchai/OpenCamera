'''
Baseline (reference) implementation of a na√Øve auto-exposure algorithm.
This algorithm is intentionally simple and purely Python so that it can act as
an easy-to-beat reference for performance and quality evaluations of the real
OpenCam implementation.

    The controller computes image brightness as the mean of all pixels and then
    derives an exposure value that tries to bring the brightness close to 0.5
    in the [0,1] range.

    The formula is intentionally simple so that the implementation is easy to
    reason about and fast to execute in pure Python.  This makes it a useful
    baseline for *both* performance and quality comparisons.
