## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### 2. Contact Us Privately

Send an email to **security@llamasearch.ai** with:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations

### 3. What to Include

Please include as much information as possible:

```

[Detailed description of the vulnerability]

Steps to Reproduce:
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

Impact:
[What could an attacker achieve?]

Environment:
- OS: [e.g., Ubuntu 20.04]
- Compiler: [e.g., GCC 9.4]
- OpenCam Version: [e.g., 1.0.0]

Additional Information:
[Any other relevant details]
```

### 4. Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports within:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed response with timeline
- **30 days**: Fix or mitigation (for critical issues)

### 5. Responsible Disclosure

We follow responsible disclosure principles:

1. **Investigation**: We investigate all reports thoroughly
2. **Fix Development**: We develop and test fixes privately
3. **Coordination**: We coordinate with reporters on disclosure timeline
4. **Public Disclosure**: We publish security advisories after fixes are available

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- **Static Analysis**: Automated security scanning with CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular vulnerability checks for dependencies
- **Memory Safety**: Use of RAII and smart pointers in C++
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Bounds Checking**: Array bounds checking and buffer overflow prevention

### Build Security

- **Compiler Flags**: Security-focused compilation flags
- **Sanitizers**: Address and undefined behavior sanitizers
- **Reproducible Builds**: Deterministic build process
- **Supply Chain**: Verified dependencies and checksums

### API Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All API inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Authentication**: Secure API key management (when applicable)
- **HTTPS**: All communications use encrypted connections
- **CORS**: Proper Cross-Origin Resource Sharing configuration

### Container Security

- **Minimal Images**: Use of distroless or minimal base images
- **Non-Root**: Containers run as non-root users
- **Security Scanning**: Regular container vulnerability scanning
- **Secrets Management**: Secure handling of sensitive information

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest supported version
2. **Secure Configuration**: Follow security configuration guidelines
3. **Network Security**: Use proper network security measures
4. **Access Control**: Implement appropriate access controls
5. **Monitoring**: Monitor for unusual activity or errors

### For Developers

1. **Secure Coding**: Follow secure coding practices
2. **Code Review**: All code changes require security review
3. **Testing**: Include security testing in development process
4. **Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated and secure
5. **Documentation**: Document security considerations

## Known Security Considerations

### Image Processing

- **Malicious Images**: The library processes user-provided images
- **Memory Usage**: Large images may cause memory exhaustion
- **Format Validation**: Image format validation is crucial
- **Buffer Overflows**: Careful handling of image data buffers

### API Endpoints

- **Input Validation**: All API inputs must be validated
- **File Uploads**: Image uploads require careful handling
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoints should implement rate limiting
- **Error Disclosure**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in errors

### Python Bindings

- **Memory Management**: Proper memory management between C++ and Python
- **Exception Handling**: Secure exception handling across language boundaries
- **Type Safety**: Type validation for Python inputs

## Security Updates

### Notification

Security updates are communicated through:

- **GitHub Security Advisories**: Official security advisories
- **Release Notes**: Detailed information in release notes
- **Email Notifications**: For critical vulnerabilities (if subscribed)

### Update Process

1. **Assessment**: Evaluate impact and affected versions
2. **Fix Development**: Develop and test security fixes
3. **Release**: Create security release with fixes
4. **Advisory**: Publish security advisory with details
5. **Communication**: Notify users through appropriate channels

## Compliance

This project aims to comply with:

- **OWASP Guidelines**: Web application security practices
- **CWE Standards**: Common Weakness Enumeration guidelines
